# Neuron React

Neuron Global State Manager for React.js. This is a React.js specific global state management library that uses Neuron Vanilla internally to manage state. It is fast, small, and does not need React Context to manage state. It uses a declarative approach for instantiating stores and uses hooks to manage those stores.
