title: Neuron Global State Manager
description: The Neuron Global State Manager is a small, bare bones, framework agnostic library for managing client state in javascript applications. Neuron Vanilla can be used in any js application by itself or you can tailor it to your framework of choice. My goal is to create framework specific version of this that use vanilla under the hood.

## Why Neuron

I created Neuron because I wanted a light weight state management solution that could scale no matter the size of the project and adapt to the framework it was being used in. There are many decent solutions in the ecosystem right now, but something I have noticed is the lack of handy features like "private stores" and "ugly apis. Neuron was created from the ground up to solve these issues. Neuron can be adapted to your framework of choice, it has handy developer tools, and the vanilla package is less than 2KBs. It also has a growing list of handy modules that can be used to extend it's features.
